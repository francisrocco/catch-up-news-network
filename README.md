# Catch Up News Network

A mock social network for people to post and share news with their friends. Users can follow each other, upvote and downvote posts, and discuss current events via websocket-enabled comments.

This project was built by this repository's collaborators at the Flatiron School (July - Oct 2016) to showcase various key concepts:

* Relationships and complex associations between multiple models

* Asynchronous JavaScript and XML calls

* WebSockets / ActionCable

and other Ruby on Rails techniques.
