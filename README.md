This is the Catch Up News Network. A social network for people who want to read the news based on articles their friends recommend. A user can sign up, post articles, and follow other users to view their shared articles.

This was a project built by this repos collaborators at the Flatiron School to showcase some key concepts recently learned, including:

* Relationships and associations between multiple models

* Asynchronous JavaScript and XML calls

* WebSockets / ActionCable

and numerous other Ruby on Rails techniques.
